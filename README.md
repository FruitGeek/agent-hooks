# 1Password Agent Hooks

This repository provides 1Password agent hooks that run inside supported IDEs and AI agents. The hooks fire on agent events (e.g. before shell or tool use) to validate, verify, and automate 1Password setup so commands run with the right secrets and config.

## Overview

1Password agent hooks validate and verify 1Password setup when supported agents run commands. They run on agent events (e.g. before shell or tool use) and help prevent errors from missing or invalid 1Password config.

Configuration is agent-specific and may use config files or editor settings. Scope depends on the agent:

- **Project-specific**: e.g. `.cursor/hooks.json`, `.github/hooks/hooks.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, or `.windsurf/hooks.json` in the project root (applies only to that project)

Other levels (user-specific or global) may be supported by some agents. See each agent’s documentation for details. The table below in **Supported Agents** references documentation.

## Installation

This repo includes an install script that copies hook files (bin, lib, adapters, and hooks) into a bundle. Run it from this repo’s root. The script uses `--agent` to pick paths and config for each supported agent.

### Initial setup
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run the install script from the repo root. Choose one of the two ways below:
   - [**Bundle**](#bundle) — build in current directory and you move it and add config.
   - [**Bundle and Move**](#bundle-and-move) — install into a target directory and script can create config from a template.

#### Bundle

Create a portable bundle in the current directory (no config file). Move the folder wherever you want (e.g. a project repo or your user config directory) and add your agent's hooks config so it runs the bundle's `bin/run-hook.sh <hook-name>` for the events you need.

```bash
./install.sh --agent <agent>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Cursor: creates cursor-1password-hooks-bundle/ in cwd
./install.sh --agent cursor

# Claude Code: creates claude-code-1password-hooks-bundle/ in cwd
./install.sh --agent claude-code

# GitHub Copilot: creates github-copilot-1password-hooks-bundle/ in cwd
./install.sh --agent github-copilot

# Windsurf (Cascade): creates windsurf-1password-hooks-bundle/ in cwd
./install.sh --agent windsurf
```

Then move that folder into the project’s directory for your agent (e.g. `.cursor/`, `.github/`, or `.windsurf/`).

⚠️ When you use Bundle, the script does not create a config file(`hooks.json`). You'll need to add or update manually. See the [**Config File**](#config-file) section below.

#### Bundle and Move

Install the bundle into a target directory (e.g. a project repo). The script creates the bundle there and, if the agent's config file doesn't already exist, creates it from a template with the correct path to `run-hook.sh`.

```bash
./install.sh --agent <agent> --target-dir /path/to/repo
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Cursor: installs into repo/.cursor/cursor-1password-hooks-bundle and repo/.cursor/hooks.json
./install.sh --agent cursor --target-dir /path/to/your/repo

# Claude Code: installs into repo/.claude/claude-code-1password-hooks-bundle and repo/.claude/settings.json
./install.sh --agent claude-code --target-dir /path/to/your/repo

# GitHub Copilot: installs into repo/.github/github-copilot-1password-hooks-bundle and repo/.github/hooks/hooks.json
./install.sh --agent github-copilot --target-dir /path/to/your/repo

# Windsurf (Cascade): installs into repo/.windsurf/windsurf-1password-hooks-bundle and repo/.windsurf/hooks.json
./install.sh --agent windsurf --target-dir /path/to/your/repo
```

If the install directory already exists, the script will ask before overwriting. Type `y` to continue or `n` to cancel.

⚠️ You may see a warning that a config file was not created. When you use `--target-dir`, the script never overwrites an existing config file. It only creates one from a template when the file is missing. See instructions below.

### Config File

For **Bundle**, the script does not create a config file. When you use **Bundle and Move**, the script only creates the agent's config file when it doesn't already exist. It never overwrites an existing config file. If you see a message that the config already exists, the script has copied the hook files but **has not** added or changed entries in your config.

**What to do:**

- **Bundle** — The script didn’t create a config file. Create it at your agent’s path (e.g. `.cursor/hooks.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.github/hooks/hooks.json`, or `.windsurf/hooks.json`), then add hook entries as in the examples below.
- **Bundle and Move** — The script did not create the config because it already existed at the target directory. Open it at the path the script printed and add or update hook entries as below.

**Steps (both):**

1. Open (or create) the config file at your agent’s path (e.g `.cursor/hooks.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.github/hooks/hooks.json`, or `.windsurf/hooks.json`).
2. Add or update hook entries so they run `<bundle-name>/bin/run-hook.sh <hook-name>` for the events you want. The path is relative to the config file’s directory.

**Example config files:**

Cursor — `.cursor/hooks.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "beforeShellExecution": [
      {
        "command": "cursor-1password-hooks-bundle/bin/run-hook.sh 1password-validate-mounted-env-files"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Claude Code — `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "claude-code-1password-hooks-bundle/bin/run-hook.sh 1password-validate-mounted-env-files"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Verifying installation

1. **Hook files** — The bundle directory should contain `bin/run-hook.sh`, `lib/`, `adapters/`, and `hooks/`.
2. **Config** — Your agent's config file should include an entry that runs `run-hook.sh` with the hook name.
3. **Run it** — Use the agent or IDE as usual. The hook runs on the configured event. Check the agent's output or logs to confirm.

## Telemetry

These hooks emit **opt-in** telemetry so 1Password can understand how agent hooks are installed and used (e.g. plugin vs. script installs, which agents trigger hooks, and how often validation fails). The hooks never make network calls — events are written to a local file that the 1Password desktop app ingests.

### What's collected

Two event types, both free of PII:

- **`agent_hook_execution`** — one per hook run. Records the hook name and version, the client (`cursor`, `claude-code`, `github-copilot`, `windsurf`), the triggering event (e.g. `before_shell_execution`), the decision (`allow` / `deny`) and a coarse reason when denied, a bucketed run duration, the time the hook ran, and — for hooks that validate mounts — the validation mode and the number of files checked.
- **`agent_hook_install`** — one per install. Records the client, the hook name and version, and how it was installed (`install_script` when installed via `install.sh`, `manual` for a manually-copied bundle). Plugin-marketplace installs are reported separately by the plugin itself.

No file paths, file contents, environment names, secrets, or other PII are ever collected.

### Opt-in and consent

Events are written **only** when the file `~/.config/1Password/telemetry-enabled` exists. The 1Password desktop app creates and removes this file based on your in-app telemetry preference. If the app has never run or you've opted out, the file is absent and **no events are written to disk at all**. Events for opted-out accounts are also dropped on the app side before anything leaves your machine.

### Where events go

Events are appended as JSON lines to:

```
~/.config/1Password/data/hook-events/events.jsonl
```

The 1Password desktop app periodically reads and removes this file and forwards events to 1Password's telemetry pipeline. The file is capped at 1 MB. Telemetry is only emitted on **macOS and Linux**.

### Fail-open

Telemetry is best-effort and isolated so it can never affect a hook's decision: any failure (no consent, disk full, missing tools) is silently ignored and the hook proceeds normally.

### Turning it off

Open the 1Password desktop app → **Settings → Manage Account → Data Usage** and turn off product telemetry. The consent file is then removed and the hooks stop writing events.
